# Carbon Intensity Dashboard

**Overview**  
The Carbon Intensity Dashboard is a mobile app that allows users to monitor real-time and daily carbon intensity, helping them make energy usage decisions based on current carbon levels. By using data from the UKâ€™s Carbon Intensity API, the app displays live national carbon intensity and a graph of half-hourly intensity for the current day.

**Features**
- **Live Carbon Intensity**: Shows current national carbon intensity in an easy-to-read widget.
- **Daily Intensity Graph**: Visualizes half-hourly carbon intensity trends for the day.
- **Error and Loading States**: Provides smooth handling of loading and data errors.

**API Integration**  
Using the [Carbon Intensity API (v2.0.0)](https://carbon-intensity.github.io/api-definitions/#carbon-intensity-api-v2-0-0):
- `/intensity` for live intensity data
- `/intensity/date` for half-hourly data throughout the day
